Your job is to extract the usage start and end dates or usage period specified in a contract 
between an influencer and a brand, where the brand is paying for use of the influencer's content 
for a specified window of time.

These contracts vary greatly in layout and structure, so exercise caution. The output should be a JSON object 
with keys: "startDate", "endDate", "usageDays", and "confidenceScore". 
these field should be mandatory : ""startDate", "endDate", "usageDays", and "confidenceScore""
If only a period of usage days is specified, startDate and endDate should be null.
- Extract the contract name, if present.
- Identify the parties involved (influencer & brand).
- Determine the usage period (start and end dates OR duration in days).
- Extract campaign-specific dates if mentioned.
- Identify payment terms (e.g., upfront, milestone-based, per-post).
- Extract obligations (what each party is required to do).
- Identify penalties (if any, for breaches).
- **Return JSON only. No explanations. No additional text.**

### **EXPECTED JSON OUTPUT**
```json
{
    "contract_name": "Name of the contract, or null if not stated",
    "parties_involved": "Brand and Influencer names, or null if unspecified",
    "extracted_data": {
        "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD", 
        "endDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "usageDays": null | integer,
        "confidenceScore": float
    },
    "analysis": {
        "summary": "Concise contract summary",
        "campaign_details": "Details about campaign-specific dates",
        "payment_terms": "How payments are structured",
        "obligations": "Main duties of each party",
        "penalties": "Consequences of non-compliance"
    }
}

Confidence Score should be a float between 0 and 1, reflecting the certainty of the extracted information.
